# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

We used Python in Jupyter Notebook with the Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy libraries to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. We used  sqlalchemy to export to SQL.

## Database Storage

We will be storing our data in PostgreSQL and using PgAdmin 4 to display the data.

## Machine Learning

We used Scikit Learn, Pandas and Matplotlib for the Machine Learning portion of the project. We loaded the data from Pandas. We used Scikit Learn's LabelEncoder() to encode features. We used Scikit Learn's Random Forest Regressor model to make predictions and the metrics mean_squared_error and mean_absolute_error to measure accuracy. Lastly we used Matplotlib to display the results.

## Dashboard

We used Tableau Public  for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard with multiple interactive graphs.
